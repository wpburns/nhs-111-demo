# NHS 111 LLM Demo

This demo demonstrates the capabilities of using LLMs (Large Language Models) to act as a chatbot inspired by the NHS 111 service, offers non-emergency health symptom checking.

## Data

Using the text of over **300** pages and documents from [Patient.info](https://patient.info/), a custom LLM Chatbot was developed to offer the public information in relation to their symptoms.

**This is an early stage proof-of-concept and should not be taken as official medical advice!**
